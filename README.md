# Black-Jack
This project will involve creating an AI agent that can play black jack in a our own created environment of the game. The agent will learn to play the game using Q-learning and will be trained over a course of time on a raspberry-pi. The resulting agent will then be put into a streamlit web app where the user can play black jack with the AI and dealer.
